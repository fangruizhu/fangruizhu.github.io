I am a second-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Dr. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) at Khoury College of Computer Science, Northeastern University. Before that, I received my B.Eng. from Tongji University and MS. from Fudan University. My research interests mainly focus on human-centric visual reasoning and self-supervised learning. Here is my [curriculum vita](https://fangruizhu.github.io/files/resume_Fangrui_Zhu.pdf).
