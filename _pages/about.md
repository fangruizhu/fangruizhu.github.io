I am Fangrui Zhu (朱方瑞), a third-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) at Khoury College of Computer Science, Northeastern University. Before that, I received my B.Eng. from Tongji University and MS. from Fudan University. My research interests mainly focus on Multi-modal visual relationship detection and visual grounding. Here is my [resume](https://fangruizhu.github.io/files/resume_Fangrui_Zhu.pdf).
